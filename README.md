# YUV-Video-Overlay-Ittiam-introductory-exercise
An introductory exercise at ittiam to get familiarised with YUV frames and general video and image formats.

We were given a YUV $1280 \times 720 $ 720 video file (bee on a sunflower), and a YUV $100 \times 160$ file (ittiam logo).

The exercise required us to overlay the logo over the video file and sweep it over the video left to right and top to bottom, I added a funny motion instead.

The final video is in the repo. The raw YUV files are too big to upload on github.
